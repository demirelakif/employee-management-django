# :office_worker: Employee Management System

This project is a Django-based application developed to manage employees' leave days, working hours, and annual leave requests. The application ensures that any tardiness by an employee results in a deduction from their annual leave, based on the time difference. Additionally, it allows employees to request leave, and enables supervisors to approve or reject these requests.
## üöÄ Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login/logout for different user roles.
- **Employee Management:** Employees can track their annual leave days and create leave requests.
- **Manager Panel:** Managers can approve or reject employee leave requests.
- **Time Management:** The system deducts annual leave hours if an employee is tardy, based on the duration of the delay.
- **Annual Leave Allocation:**  Every new employee is automatically granted 15 days of annual leave at the time of registration.
